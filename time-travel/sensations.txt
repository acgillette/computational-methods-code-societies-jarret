My jaw hurts for no reason, im not nervous so it shouldn't and someone whistled which I feel like is an 'artificial' way of making noise. Ykno? I mean look we all want to participate in the spirit of the thing and there's no room for skepticism, but I hear a lot of typing, nad I am typing, and my hands are just a ~lil~ bit slippery from the shea butter in my hair and i really want mint chocolate right now, and my sock is slipping down my right foot and i'm going to adjust it literally any second now,someone is playing MUSIC and it is Agnes Obel who i've never heard of so now I'm seeing Spotify and looking for artists
